It is available both as an embedded solution and as a device hosed in an alluminum casing with besels, thus facilitating different installation oprions:

+ Installation on an idustrial cabient
+ Integration with the existing equipment

This |product| offers a very low power consumption, despite its processing capabilites. Is powered by the very low power i.MX6UL |Arm| |Cortex|-A7 Application Processor Unit (APU) from Freescale (now NXP) runnung at up to 528 MHz. 

|Product| also features a broad range of connectivity options, providing a rich scalability for many different use cases. It is the perfect sotultion for power-constrained applications on the edge, acting as a small but powerful control unit for collection and aggregation of field data. i.MX 6 applications processors are part of NXP's EdgeVerse™ edge computing platform.

The i.MX6UL MCU does not generate extensive heat, so even the thin aluminum housing on PPC version delivers sufficien thermal dissipation. With its junction temperature from -20 to +140°C the APU itslef is well suited for extended temperarure range in both automotive of factory environments.
