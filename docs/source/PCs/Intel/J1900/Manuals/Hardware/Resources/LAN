LAN Connectors
---------------

Two RJ45 connectors *(Figure 4)* provide LAN or Internet connection via standard Ethernet cables. Use certified CAT 5E Ethernet cables or better to achieve the full data throughput
defined by the standard.

The integrated two-port Ethernet interface supports automatic speed negotiation and Wake on LAN, but does not support Power over Ethernet (PoE).
