LAN Connectors
---------------

Two RJ45 connectors *(Figure 4)* enable LAN or Internet connection over standard Ethernet cables. Use certified CAT 5E Ethernet cables or better to achieve full data throughput 
defined by the standard. The integrated Ethernet dual-port interface supports auto-speed negotiation and Wake on LAN, but it does not support Power over Ethernet (PoE).
