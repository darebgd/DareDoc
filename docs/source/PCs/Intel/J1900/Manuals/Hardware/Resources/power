Power Input Connector
---------------------

|Product| can use a wide range of input voltages: from 9V to 30V DC. The power input connector is a 2-pin, 3.81mm screw terminal *(Figure 1)*.
The polarity of the power connector is clearly labeled on the housing itself: the '**+**' sign is the positive, while the '**-**' sign is the negative power supply input.
The power button is located next to the power input connector and can be used to switch the power ON or OFF.
