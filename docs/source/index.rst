Chipsee Documentation Drafts
============================

This documentation repository contains all products collaterals (manuals, certifications, 3D files, brochures, whitepapers) and custom OS downloads that may be used with the Chipsee industrial 
products. Chipsee's clever product naming scheme allows for quick extraction of the key features from the product numbers, so familiarizing yourself with the :ref:`naming-rules` makes navigating through this
repository much simpler.
